# LingoFlow-Automated-Language-Translation-Pipeline-with-AWS
LingoFlow is a serverless application for seamless multilingual voice translation. It uses AWS Transcribe for voice-to-text, Amazon Translate for language conversion, and Amazon Polly for text-to-speech. AWS Step Functions automate the entire workflow, orchestrating multiple Lambda functions for real-time, efficient translation.
